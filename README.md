## Automated ELK Stack Deployment

The files in this repository were used to configure the network depicted below.

These files have been tested and used to generate a live ELK deployment on Azure. They can be used to either recreate the entire deployment pictured above. Alternatively, select portions of the Azure Cloud Environment file may be used to install only certain pieces of it, such as Filebeat.

### Description of the Topology

The main purpose of this network is to expose a load-balanced and monitored instance of DVWA, the D*mn Vulnerable Web Application.

Load balancing ensures that the application will be highly reliable, in addition to restricting access to the network.
- Load Balancers protect against DoS attacks. The advantage of the jump box is that it restricts access to one administrator.
Integrating an ELK server allows users to easily monitor the vulnerable VMs for changes to the actual machines and system logs.
- Filebeat helps generate and organize log files to send to Logstash and Elasticsearch. Specifically, it logs information about the file system, including which files have changed and when.
- Metricbeat is a lightweight shipper that you can install on your servers to periodically collect metrics from the operating system and from services running on the server. Metricbeat takes the metrics and statistics that it collects and ships them to the output that you specify, such as Elasticsearch or Logstash.

The configuration details of each machine may be found below:
```git
| Name                 | Function         | IP Address | Operating System |
|----------------------|------------------|------------|------------------|
| Jump-Box-Provisioner | Gateway          | 10.0.0.7   | Linux            |
| Web-1                | DVWA Containers  | 10.0.0.12  | Linux            |
| Web-2                | DVWA Containers  | 10.0.0.13  | Linux            |
| Web-3                | DVWA Containers  | 10.0.0.14  | Linux            |
| ELK                  | Configuration VM | 10.1.0.4   | Linux            |
```

### Access Policies

The machines on the internal network are not exposed to the public Internet. 

Only the Jump Box machine can accept connections from the Internet. Access to this machine is only allowed from the following IP addresses:
- 76.171.145.84 - my personal machine.

Machines within the network can only be accessed by accessing the DVWA container in the Jump Box VM.
- The only machine that can access the ELK server is 76.171.145.84 - my personal machine.

A summary of the access policies in place can be found in the table below:
```git
| Name                 | Publicly Accessible | Allowed IP Address      |
|----------------------|---------------------|-------------------------|
| Jump-Box-Provisioner | Yes                 | 10.0.0.7, 76.171.145.84 |
| Web-1                | No                  | 10.0.0.7                |
| Web-2                | No                  | 10.0.0.7                |
| Web-3                | No                  | 10.0.0.7                |
| ELK                  | Yes                 | 10.0.0.7, 76.171.145.84 |
```

### ELK Configuration

Ansible was used to automate configuration of the ELK machine. No configuration was performed manually, which is advantageous because...
- You don’t need to install any other software or firewall ports on the client systems you want to automate. You also don’t have to set up a separate management structure.

The playbook implements the following tasks:
- Install Docker
- Download Image
- Configure container
- Run playbook to launch the container

The following screenshot displays the result of running `docker ps` after successfully configuring the ELK instance.

### Target Machines & Beats
This ELK server is configured to monitor the following machines:
- 10.0.0.12 - Web-1
- 10.0.0.13 - Web-2
- 10.0.0.14 - Web-3

We have installed the following Beats on these machines:
- Filebeat
- Metricbeat

These Beats allow us to collect the following information from each machine:
- **Filebeat** monitors the log files or locations that you specify, collects log events, and forwards them either to Elasticsearch or Logstash for indexing.
- **Metricbeat** periodically collect metrics from the operating system and from services running on the server. Metricbeat takes the metrics and statistics that it collects and ships them to the output that you specify, such as Elasticsearch or Logstash.
### Using the Playbook
In order to use the playbook, you will need to have an Ansible control node already configured. Assuming you have such a control node provisioned: 

SSH into the control node and follow the steps below:
- Go to /etc/ansible/files and use the curl command to add the config file:
```bash
curl https://gist.githubusercontent.com/slape/5cc350109583af6cbe577bbcc0710c93/raw/eca603b72586fbe148c11f9c87bf96a63cb25760/Filebeat > /etc/ansible/files/filebeat-config.yml
```
- Copy the filebeat-playbook.yml file to /etc/ansible/roles.
- Update the filebeat-config.yml file to include the ELK server private IP in lines 1106 and 1806.
- Run the filebeat-playbook.yml playbook, and navigate to the kibana page at [ELK public IP]/app/kibana to check that the installation worked as expected.
